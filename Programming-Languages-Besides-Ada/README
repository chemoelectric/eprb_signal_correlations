Here repose translations of the simulation from Ada into other
programming languages. The extensive comments in the Ada, containing a
derivation of the correlation coefficient without recourse to quantum
physics, are left out.

The random number generators are not necessarily the same as in the
Ada program, and neither need be execution orders nor run lengths, and
thus numbers produced may be different.  A given program might in fact
produce different numbers on different runs, although we will try to
avoid that.

These programs all generate data using the tagging algorithm, and then
analyze the data by substituting frequencies for probabilities in the
correlation coefficient.
