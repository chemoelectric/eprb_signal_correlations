Here repose translations of the program from the Ada into other
programming languages. The extensive comments in the Ada, containing a
derivation of the correlation coefficient, are left out.

The random number generators are not necessarily the same as in the
Ada program, and neither need be execution orders nor the run lengths,
and thus the numbers produced may differ.  A given program might in
fact produce different numbers on different runs, although we will try
to avoid that.

These programs all generate data using the tagging algorithm, and then
analyze the data by substituting frequencies for probabilities in the
correlation coefficient.
